#### UVG Workshop in Practical Phonetics ####

Robert and Ryan, in concert graduate research assistant Meg Harvey, organized a two day workshop on ELAN at the Comunidad Lingüística Uspanteka in San Miguel Uspantán. Attendees were introduced to the basics of ELAN, as well as how to produce materials for the broader community from annotated ELAN files. Over the course of the workshop, attendees worked in teams to produce small subtitled videos, which were shared on the final day. The workshop was attended by youth and adults from Uspantán, as well as the neighboring state Alta Verapaz. There were speakers of Uspanteko, K'iche', and Poqomchi' in attendance.
