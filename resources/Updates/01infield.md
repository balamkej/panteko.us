#### Recording in Uspant&aacute;n ####

Ryan and Robert were in Uspant&aacute;n in June / July 2016 to run the first in a set of experiments on the prosody of Uspanteko. The team was graciously hosted by the Comunidad Ling&uuml;&iacute;stica Uspanteka. Twenty-two speakers were recorded over two weeks from multiple Uspanteko-speaking communities in the area.
