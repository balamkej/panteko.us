#### ICPhS 2019 ####

Team Tz'&uacute;nun was in Australia in August 2019 for the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, a premier conference in phonetics held every four years with participants from all over the world. We presented two papers that made cricial use of our work on Uspanteko: "The interaction of tone and intonation in Uspanteko" and "Unite and conquer: Bootstrapping forced alignment tools for closely-related minority languages (Mayan)."
