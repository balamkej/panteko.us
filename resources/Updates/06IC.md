Team Tz'&uacute;unun was in Australia in August 2019 for the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, a premier conference held every four years with participants from all over the world. We presented two papers that made cricial use of our work on Uspanteko, in particular, "The interaction of tone and intonation in Uspanteko" and "Unite and conquer: Bootstrapping forced alignment tools for closely-related minority languages (Mayan)."
