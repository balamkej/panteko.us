#### Explorations in Ultrasound ####

In the summer of 2019, the Uspanteko team began a new set of experiments to study syncope. In particular, we are interested in whether vowels that undergo syncope are completely unrealized or merely reduced. To do this, we are using ultrasound to measure the physical activity of the vocal folds during words that contains vowels that undergo syncope.
